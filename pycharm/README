I just download the pycharm community tarball and extract it to /opt

  sudo tar -xvf <pycharm_tar> -C /opt
  sudo chown matt:matt -R /opt/pycharm...

I then have a link '/opt/pycharm' that points the latest pycharm version:

  lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 26 Oct 23 13:31 /opt/pycharm -> pycharm-community-2017.2.3

All I then need to do is add `/opt/pycharm/bin` to my PATH.

If your using gnome and want to be able to find it in your menu just place the `pycharm.desktop` in this directory into `~/.local/share/applications/`:

  cp pycharm.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
