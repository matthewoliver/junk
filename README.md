Junk
===========

This repoistory contains random junk code and scripts that people may find
useful.. or not.. at least I do. 


Code:
=========
gearcat.py:
    usage: gearcat.py <gearman_server> <gearman_port> 
    Desc: 
      Connects the the given gearman server and runs the Status Admin 
      Request and prints the result to the screen. 
      SO: cat for gearman.. in a way.
